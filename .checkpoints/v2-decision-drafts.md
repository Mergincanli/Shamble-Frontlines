# Checkpoint: v2-decision-drafts
- **Goal:** the v2 decision drafts (`docs/ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/adr/0001`–`0006`, the spike plan, the loose ends)
  from the drafts brief (`v2-decision-drafts/inputs/DRAFTS_BRIEF.md`), then a draft PR, the report and a stop for Mustafa
  and the Advisor · plan: `v2-decision-drafts/plan.md` (revision 3: the advisor's APPROVE of revision 1 with 19 conditions folded in revision 2, verdict verbatim in `advisor-verdicts.md` §1; revision 3 applies Mustafa's UPGRADE-SCOPE update)
- **Branch:** claude/laughing-lovelace-ox61se (the session's branch, standing in for cs/v2-decision-drafts) ·
  **Base:** origin/main 9e7db28 (PR #32's merge)
- **Last update:** 2026-10-31 22:56 Amsterdam

## Steps done
1. Step 0 (brief §0): `docs/LOOK_V2.md` added byte for byte (sha256 52b4fc06…) · 6617e25; the brief copied to `inputs/`;
   plan revision 1 written · d6c71e4.
2. Plan review: the advisor's APPROVE with 19 conditions (about 18:35); folded into plan revision 2 (no second review
   needed, per the verdict); `origin/main` fetched to 9e7db28 (condition 1); the id list rebuilt (REC 165: the two R3
   rows were references, condition 6) · 5ab5eae.
3. Mustafa's UPGRADE-SCOPE update (about 18:41, in the session's chat; it replaces the brief's upgrade note): saved
   verbatim to `inputs/UPGRADE-SCOPE-mustafa-2026-10-31.md`; plan revision 3 applies it (settled inputs, the ADR 0005
   paragraph, the map addendum's part (e), docs-keeper's STATUS record) · f927ab3.
4. Decision map (step 2) done; coverage script: 521 of 521 ids, one owner each; addendum sent; drafting started
   (0003, 0006, 0005's ability section) · b2719db.
5. The map's addendum done (part j); 0001 and 0004 launched · deeea0d.
6. Spend-limit cut (about 19:18) recorded; resumed after the reset (22:52); 0006 and 0005's ability section finished;
   0002 and 0005's content part launched before 23:00 · this commit.

## Current step
Step 3, drafting. Cut at about 19:18 by the org spend limit, resumed at about 22:52 after the reset (Mustafa: "it has
reset now"). Done: ADR 0006 (infra-engineer: 966 lines, ledger 355 rows, Appendix A 65/65; notes DONE) and ADR 0005's
ability section (game-designer: 624 lines, ledger 295 rows, Appendix A rows 7/7; notes DONE). Running: 0001
(netcode-architect, resumed), 0003 + 0005 GPU section (graphics-engineer, resumed), 0004 (rust-reviewer, resumed),
0002 (engine-architect, launched 22:54), 0005 content data and asset pipeline (engine-architect, launched 22:55). No new
agent after 23:00 (condition 17).

## Next steps
1. Tonight: only the five resumed units finish (no new agent after 23:00, no fetching verifier after 22:00; condition
   17). A unit still running at 00:10 is recorded here; the next day session reads its notes before using its result.
2. Next day session (daytime): 0002 (`prompts/engine-architect-adr0002.txt`); 0005's content data
   (`prompts/engine-architect-adr0005-content.txt`) and frame (`prompts/engine-architect-adr0005-frame.txt`, after the
   three sections); test-engineer's pass marks per draft (`prompts/_test-engineer-passmarks-TEMPLATE.txt`); assembly
   (`v2-decision-drafts/scripts/assemble.py`; the session's scripts are copied into `v2-decision-drafts/scripts/` so a
   new container has them); synthesis; verification (`prompts/_verifier-TEMPLATE.txt`); consistency; fixes; reviews;
   docs-keeper; gate; report; draft PR.
2. Pass marks per draft as each lands (step 4); assembly (step 5); synthesis (step 6); verification (step 7; no
   fetching verifier after 22:00, no new agent after 23:00).

## Open findings
- The research has no asset-pipeline findings (ASSET-RESEARCH, in the plan).

## Key numbers
- Research ids defined in r1–r6 at 9e7db28 (`inputs/research-ids.tsv`, built by script, rebuilt after the review): 533
  rows, 521 unique ids: REC 165, OQ 241, RR 7, XU 30, XT 72, 6 shared codes (18 copies). Matches the research report's
  165 recommendations and 278 own open questions (241 + 30 + 7).
- Findings checked by each topic's verifier (`inputs/findings-checked.tsv`, script-built guide): R1 172/185, R2 136/152,
  R3 44/92, R4 49/62, R5 49/117, R6 18/42.

## Decisions taken
- 2026-10-31: the drafts brief (Mustafa and the Advisor) and LOOK_V2 (attachments of the session's first message).
- 2026-10-31 about 18:41, Mustafa: the UPGRADE-SCOPE update (tracks per unit and per weapon type, pick one of three per
  level, owned by the player, surviving death and switching, reset every match; a class comes with its own weapon;
  other weapons only from enemy drops, as world pickups; progress on the weapon type; on the PlayerState). Open for him:
  carry slots, ammo for looted weapons, track levelling speed with catch-up.
- 2026-10-31 about 18:35, the advisor: plan APPROVE with 19 conditions; rulings ASSET-RESEARCH (a), TICK-60-HEADROOM
  ruled now (base 8.33 ms, p99 ≤ 6.25 ms; confirmed at the stop), GLOSSARY-8 yes (three entries and a note),
  CHECKPOINT-AT-STOP keep.

## Running work
- advisor plan review: done (APPROVE), notes `advisor-plan-review.md` (DONE).
- engine-architect decision map: done about 18:45 (521 of 521 ids, one owner each: 0001 127, 0002 104, 0003 71,
  0004 82, 0005 34, 0006 65, DESIGN 38); its addendum (part j, from line 1032) done about 18:52, owners unchanged,
  coverage re-run 521/521; GLOSSARY §8 text in part J1.
- Drafting, launched about 18:53: netcode-architect (0001; `netcode-architect-adr0001-notes.md`), rust-reviewer (0004;
  `rust-reviewer-adr0004-notes.md`).
- Drafting, launched about 18:48 (background agents, effort xhigh, opus): graphics-engineer (0003 + 0005 asset section;
  notes `graphics-engineer-adr0003-notes.md`), infra-engineer (0006; `infra-engineer-adr0006-notes.md`), game-designer
  (0005 ability section; `game-designer-adr0005-notes.md`). Prompts in `prompts/`.
- checkpoint saver: `checkpoint.mjs watch` ran 18:22–20:12 and ended (its 110 minutes); restarted at about 22:55.
- Spend-limit cut, 2026-10-31 about 19:18 Amsterdam: agents netcode-architect (0001), infra-engineer (0006),
  rust-reviewer (0004), graphics-engineer (0003, 0005 asset section), game-designer (0005 ability section) failed with
  HTTP 429 "org's monthly spend limit … your 5-hour limit resets 9:50pm (UTC)"; each resumed from its notes by message
  after the reset.
