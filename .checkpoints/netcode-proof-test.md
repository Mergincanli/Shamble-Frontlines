# Checkpoint: netcode-proof-test
- **Goal:** start the netcode proof test (SPIKE_PLAN item 1) as its own change-set; this step is the PLAN only, for the
  advisor's review and Mustafa's (no code before approval) · plan: `.checkpoints/netcode-proof-test/plan.md` (to write)
- **Branch:** `claude/netcode-proof-test-plan-hcky5g` (this cloud session's stand-in for `cs/netcode-proof-test`) ·
  **Base:** main `af8393e9d40f3bd382e77f86e6df2612785c706c`
- **Last update:** 2026-11-05 23:25 Amsterdam

## Steps done
1. SSH reachability probe (plan item 1, first pass) · this commit · NO: no ssh client in the image; TCP 22 and every
   port but 443 time out, direct and via the proxy; 443 is TLS-re-terminated by the egress gateway. Evidence:
   `.checkpoints/netcode-proof-test/ssh-probe.md`. So the plan proposes cloud-init and/or Claude Code on Mustafa's PC.
   Second pass (no commit of its own): any public HTTPS host is readable (nasa.gov, ikea.com, Let's Encrypt's ACME
   directory: 200); shamblefrontlines.com is on Cloudflare (NS cora/steven), no A/AAAA/CAA yet.
2. Requirement digests · workflow `wf_1ae38d53-da9`, 3 of 3 returned (netcode-architect 52 KB, infra-engineer 71 KB,
   test-engineer 48 KB, each ends DONE) · saved by 4e15330 and the saver · findings: ~20 readings for the advisor
   (reordering at P3, packet count, loopback LAN, x86-64 replays, L2 delay formula, OQ-0001-9 cover, stand-in
   conditions, bites, runner list, ML close, ports, cert method, metrics path, host keys) and 2 for Mustafa (route
   and its machine; Safari timed rows).

## Current step
3. Writing the plan (revision 1) from the digests: `.checkpoints/netcode-proof-test/plan.md`.

## Next steps
3. Write the plan from the digests: `.checkpoints/netcode-proof-test/plan.md`.
4. Plan review round (at most 3 agents): security-auditor (SSH key, certificates, firewall, cloud-init, the Safari
   workflow), engine-architect (spikes/ layout, the harness shared with the boundary spike), a completeness critic
   (every pass mark covered).
5. Fix, then the advisor's plan review (APPROVE / REVISE / ESCALATE); iterate on REVISE.
6. Push, open the draft PR, report to Mustafa (Decisions needed, For Mustafa).

## Open findings
- (none yet)

## Key numbers
- Hetzner, excl. VAT, read 2026-11-05 (infra digest D): CCX23 EUR 0.1386/h, CAX21 EUR 0.0176/h (plan prices include
  IPv4); 1 RS + 1 LG = 0.1562/h; each VM rounds up per session; RS<->LG traffic internal and free.
- Rust stable 1.99.1 (2026-10-13; static.rust-lang.org answers 200); container has 1.97.0, x86_64 target only.
- macOS runner images: macos-26 arm64 Safari 26.6.2; macos-15 arm64 Safari 27.2 (infra digest F).

## Decisions taken
- Settled inputs (Mustafa, this session's prompt, 2026-11-05): ADR 0001-0006 and SPIKE_PLAN as merged; P2 = 100 ms
  round trip, +-20 ms jitter, 2 % loss, half each way; the 60 Hz run is an early signal only; CCX23 (RS, x86) + CAX21
  (LG, Arm64) in Falkenstein, created and deleted by Mustafa per run; SSH by a public key the session gives him, never
  a Hetzner token; each run's plan states its hours and a cost cap for his OK; Safari leg tries GitHub's macOS runners
  first, any `.github/` change goes to him; shamblefrontlines.com at Cloudflare, one exact DNS record per test host,
  always "DNS only" (grey cloud).
