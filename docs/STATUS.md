# STATUS: the one-screen dashboard
_Kept current by docs-keeper after every change-set. Mustafa and the Advisor read this first._
_Last updated: 2026-10-14, map-dedupe-on-load on cs/map-dedupe-on-load._

## Phase
**Phase 0: environment + green baseline**: merged (PR #2, 2d30e4a, 2026-10-14, Advisor APPROVE; CS-1 / PR #1 approved
after the fact). Status stays **PARTIAL** until Mustafa's Windows run ("Check a new machine" in tools/README.md: npm ci,
gate, headed RTX renders, headless-gl, `/permissions`, syntax-hook test); Windows-only fixes become a small follow-up
change-set. Gate check 5 is now on main, so that machine needs a fresh `npm ci` in tools/ (eslint-scope) and Node 22.13+.
**Merged today:** editor-prefab-list (PR #4, c458fe7), gate-check-5 (PR #5, 8675367), kit-v1-2 (PR #6, ef019e0),
bot-poplar-wedge (PR #7, 159bec4).
**In flight:** editor-undo-ground (PR #8: Advisor APPROVE; Mustafa's Ctrl+Z check in Brave passed; merge on Mustafa's
go) and map-dedupe-on-load (in review: PR to be opened, based on cs/editor-undo-ground; merges after #8).
**Queue (Advisor, updated 2026-10-14; one change-set at a time):** kit-v1-2 (merged) → bot-poplar-wedge (merged) →
editor-undo-ground (approved, merge on Mustafa's go) → map-dedupe-on-load (in review; PR to be opened, based on cs/editor-undo-ground; merges after #8) → tutorial-field-manual → ui-step-2 → scale-test → ui-step-3 →
house-textures-seeded (new, low priority; seeded house textures also make before/after renders exact) → build-spike →
ADR run. Why: visual and UI work lives in the client and survives the multiplayer refactor; gameplay systems
(progression, new units, Spy, squads, three teams) wait for the foundation refactor so they are built once in the shared
simulation. editor-undo-ground's plan is APPROVED with two additions (report draw calls after 1 and 2 rebuilds vs boot;
dedupe-on-load as its own change-set right after: drop exact duplicates only, same kind, position, rotation and seed).

## Targets
- **Multiplayer:** three teams, one per faction, of 12–16 players each in squads of 4 (12v12v12 to 16v16v16, possibly
  larger): design for 48+ players. Bots fill empty slots. Milestones: 2–8 players → 16 → full scale, with load tests at
  each step.

## Decisions pending
- Taken by the Advisor 2026-10-14: gl advisories accepted for now (drop gl for Playwright-only renders if it won't
  install natively on Windows); hook path (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`) waits for the Windows run; check 5 is its own
  change-set after the prefab fix; standing permissions granted (see CLAUDE.md)
- **ADR-001 Multiplayer architecture** (authority, tick, transport, hosting, offline play): not started. Inputs logged so far: the 11 wall-clock reads (performance.now / Date.now) that make same-seed matches differ; no SRI/CSP on the three.js CDN tag; server-side map-def validation (SEC-MDL-2: `__proto__` key through `envMerge` / `rulesMerge`)
- **ADR-002 Code structure & build** (modules, bundler, TypeScript, double-click build): under discussion with Mustafa;
  evidence first via the build spike
- **ADR-003 Three.js version** (stay on r128 vs upgrade): deferred until after ADR-002
- **Design: progression** (Identity / Momentum / Mastery): framework set, details open; see docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md.
  Affects what the server must persist

## Open bugs and risks
- First-deploy tutorial lists controls that no longer exist (V melee, B shield, 1–5 switch): every new player sees it
- Editor: Ctrl+Z (undo) changes the ground textures (old, reported by Mustafa): fixed on cs/editor-undo-ground (PR #8, approved; Mustafa confirmed Ctrl+Z in Brave), pending merge. Root cause: `stylizeScene` runs only at boot, so rebuilt roads / crates / buildings / barracks / terminal lost toon + ink; also `clearMap` never cleared trees / props, so every undo / redo / reset / load stacked another copy of all 70 trees and 36 props, also into snapshots and saved maps
- Maps saved on older builds after an undo may contain duplicate trees and props: map-dedupe-on-load drops exact duplicates on Load (pending merge). Limit: on an old stacked save, Cabana trees and props that the map had deleted or moved come back once. They are single entries, so they stay; Mustafa removes them by hand. Measured on the edited fixture: 69 / 35 intended, 71 / 37 after dedupe
- Deferred (map-dedupe-on-load): prefabs saved by marquee over a stacked area can stamp exact stacks again. Exposure is small: prefabs could only be saved since dbe24f8 (2026-10-14). The next map Save and Load drops them. Follow-up: dedupe on prefab load or stamp with the same key
- Deferred, info, older (SEC-MDL-2): `envMerge` / `rulesMerge` use `Object.assign`, so a stored `__proto__` key swaps the prototype of that local env/rules sub-object (`Object.prototype` stays clean). Belongs with the server-side map-def validation (ADR-001)
- Deferred, low (editor-undo-ground PERF-2): `_disposeObj3D` disposes the shared cached BK textures (houses / covers already did on base; trees / props add the well roof `tile`). r128 re-uploads them next frame, nothing breaks. Follow-up: skip `BK._tex` textures in `_disposeObj3D`
- Pre-existing, low (art review): `serializeMap` rounds to 0.1 m, so the resupply terminal snaps about 2 cm on a rebuild; the editor playtest camera clips into the barracks roof (no roof cutaway in playtest)
- Editor three-bug entry (prefab list, Maps list, Save as prefab): fixed and merged (PR #4, c458fe7), Brave check passed
- Gate default base (stale local `main`): fixed and merged (PR #5, 8675367)
- The kit allow rule `npx --no -- playwright *` was too broad: fixed and merged (PR #6, ef019e0; now only `install chromium`)
- Deferred from gate-check-5 reviews: no SRI/CSP on the three.js CDN tag (belongs with hosting, ADR-001)
- GitHub branch protection on `main` is the real guard against pushes to main (deny rules are fragile by design);
  recommend Mustafa enables it (GitHub Pro via the Student Developer Pack if the free plan lacks it for private repos)
- The 3D scene renders every frame behind the opaque main menu (wasted GPU)
- Bot wedge at the poplar row near (-79, -83): fixed and merged (PR #7, 159bec4)
- Bot nav, editor-made layouts (R1, tracked per the Advisor): rotated colliders at odd angles keep up to 0.34 m of solid inside free nav cells, and wall gaps of about 3-5.4 m can close for bots depending on grid alignment (built-in maps unaffected). Recommendation: an editor-side reachability check; new maps keep walkable gaps at least 6 m wide
- Bot nav, navSteer "replan storm" (old; bot-poplar-wedge PERF-2): a bot whose straight line flickers clear/blocked replans every few frames; the wedge fix hits it more on Romania (budget-limited frames 0.9% -> 1.8%). Advisor: its own change-set in the greybox phase (bot-replan-storm)
- Bot nav, A* gives up after 8000 nodes (old): a few far-corner routes fail and fall back to a straight line
- The game reads performance.now()/Date.now() in 11 places, so matches with the same seed differ run to run. Tracked as an input for ADR-001 (deterministic shared simulation)
- The gate did not check execution (load order, TDZ at load, undefined identifiers, layering): addressed by check 5,
  merged (PR #5, 8675367), live in CI
